To be honest, it should be called `Polar Coordinate System`

> In mathematics, the polar coordinate system is a two-dimensional coordinate system in which each point on a plane is determined by a distance from a reference point and an angle from a reference direction.

* The `reference point` (analogous to the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system, the center point) is called the `pole`
* The `ray` from the pole in the reference direction is the `polar axis`

You can represent any point in this system with `(distance, angle)`, for example, `(3, 60 degree)`

or generally, $$(\rho, \theta)$$

$$\rho$$: rho

$$\theta$$: theta
