Something like $$\frac{a}{b}$$, split by $$-$$, we call $$a$$ `Molecular`, $$b$$ `Denominator`.

$$
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= x^2    
\\ \\ 
&\Downarrow \text{Take derivative of the previous formula} 
\\ \\
f^\prime(x) &= 2x    &(x^2)^\prime &= 2x
\\ \\
&\Downarrow \text{Take derivative of the previous formula}
\\ \\
f^{\prime \prime}(x) &= 2    &(2x)^\prime &= 2
\end{align*}
$$

We say $$f^\prime(x)$$ is the first derivative of $$f(x)$$, $$f^{\prime \prime}(x)$$ is the second derivative of $$f(x)$$. You can keep doing this by changing the number before `derivative`.

Now, let me suppose that we have a function $$f(x)$$. whatever $$x$$ you got which make $$f^\prime(x) = 0$$ or make $$f^\prime(x)$$ undefined, then we say the $$(x, f(x))$$ is a critical point.

Critical means important. Those important point we need to care.
