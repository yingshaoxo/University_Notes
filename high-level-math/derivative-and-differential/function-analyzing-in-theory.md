Computer can draw all function points without tired. But human can't, so human want to use a little of points and some `feature of that function` or `regular patterns` to draw that function.

Those points, we call it critical point.

Now, let me suppose that we have a function $$f(x)$$. whatever $$x$$ you got which make $$f^\prime(x) = 0$$ or make $$f^\prime(x)$$ undefined, then we say the $$(x, f(x))$$ is a critical point.

In these points, we will find some useful information.
