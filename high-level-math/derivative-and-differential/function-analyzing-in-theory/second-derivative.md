This is a graph about $$f(x)=e^x$$

Every red line's slop represented as a certain first derivative $$f^\prime(x)$$. 

You can see it clearly that it indeed goes steeper and steeper. 

That means $$f^\prime(x)$$ keep increasing in this interval.

So according to first derivative theory, $$f^{\prime\prime}(x)$$ must be positive.

For a function interval has the feature of $$f^{\prime\prime}(x) > 0$$, we call it `concave upwards`.

This is a graph about $$f(x)=-x^2$$

Every red line was becoming more and more gentle. 

That means $$f^\prime(x)$$ keep decreasing in this interval.

So according to first derivative theory, $$f^{\prime\prime}(x)$$ must be negative.

For a function interval has the feature of $$f^{\prime\prime}(x) < 0$$, we call it `concave downwards`.

$$f^\prime(x)$$ first decreasing , then increasing, you'll get an inflection

$$f^\prime(x)$$ first increasing, then decreasing, you'll also get an inflection
