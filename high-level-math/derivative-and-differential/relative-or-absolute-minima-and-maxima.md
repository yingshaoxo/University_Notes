### Basic

If I give you a series of number, `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, you will know that `0` is the minimum of this series, `7` is the maximum of this series.

In `function`, it also has `minimum` and `maximum`, but that comparison is based on output `y` of that `function`


### Confusing

From this graph, you could see two types of `max or min`, one is local `max or min`, another is global `max or min`.

For the local one, it's relatively to its left `y` value and its right `y` value, so we also call this `relative max or min`.

For the global one, it's absolutely greater or smaller than other values in this graph, so we also call it `absolute max or min` or `extreme max or min `


### Certain thing
A relative maximum point is a point where the function changes direction from increasing to decreasing (making that point a "peak" in the graph)

Similarly, a relative minimum point is a point where the function changes direction from decreasing to increasing (making that point a "bottom" in the gragh)
