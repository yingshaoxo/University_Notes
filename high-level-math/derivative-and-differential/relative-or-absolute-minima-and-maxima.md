I just want to give you some intuitions about what I'm gonna talk.

If I give you a series of number, `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, you definitely know that `0` is the minimum of this series, `7` is the maximum of this series.

In Function, it also has `minimum` and `maximum`, but that comparison is happened in `y` of that `function`.

For example, if I got a function $$f(x) = x^2$$, we both know that the minimun $$f(x)_{min}$$ is $$0$$

How do we know that?

One way is to draw a graph
