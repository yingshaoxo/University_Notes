If I give you a series of number, `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, you will know that `0` is the minimum of this series, `7` is the maximum of this series.

In `function`, it also has `minimum` and `maximum`, but that comparison is based on output `y` of that `function`

From this graph, you could see two types of `max or min`, one is local `max or min`, another is global `max or min`.

For the local one, it's relatively to its left `y` value and right `y` value, so we also call this `max or min` `relative max or min`

For the global one, it's absolutely greater or smaller than other values in this graph, so we also call it `absolute max or min` or `extreme max or min `. But this graph doesn't totally represent a function, it's just relative in a certain domain in that function.
