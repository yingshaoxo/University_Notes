___

Antiderivative is the reverse relation of derivative. 

For example, we know that the derivative of $$x^2$$ is $$2x$$. This means that an antiderivative of $$2x$$ is $$x^2$$.

$$\text{Indefinite integration} = \text{Anti-derivative}$$
___

The indefinite integral of $$2x$$ is expressed as $$\int 2x dx$$

In general, $$\int f^\prime(x) dx = f(x) + C$$

or

$$\int \frac{dy}{x} dx = dy$$
___

We call $$\sqrt{}$$ radical.
