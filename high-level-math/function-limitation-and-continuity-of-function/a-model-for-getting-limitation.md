If anything goes well, it indeed has a general model for you guys getting limitation from a limit equation.

```
if equation is fraction:
    if fraction + or - fraction:
        reduce fractions to one fraction by setting a common denominator
    if equation has sqrt:
        get rid of if
    if put $$x_0$$ into equation getting "$$\frac{0}{0}$$":
        get factorization, get rid of one factoring which make equation to "$$\frac{0}{0}$$"
if equation is not fraction:
    # combined with simple +-x/ 
    put $$x_0$$ in equation directly
```
