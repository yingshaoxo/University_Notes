If anything goes well, it indeed has a general model for you guys getting limitation from a limit equation.

```
if equation is a fraction:
    if fraction + or - a fraction:
        reduce fractions into one fraction by setting a common denominator
    if equation has radical sign:
        get rid of it by rationalizing.
    if put giving_x into equation getting "0/0":
        do factorization, get rid of one factor which make equation "0/0"
if equation is not a fraction: # combined with simple +-x/
    put giving_x in equation directly
```

#### Example
$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{left}
\lim{x \to +\infty}{\sqrt{x^2 - 1} - x} 
\end{left}
\end{equation}
$$
