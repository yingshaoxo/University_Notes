But so sad that I can't draw graphs for this book on this period of time.

$$
\lim_{x \to \infty}{\frac{1}{x^2}} = 0
$$

Why this happen? We could imagine, if $$x^2$$ goes on and on, to infinite, $$\frac{1}{x^2}$$ will more and more approaching $$0$$.

There's another limit equation that similar to the above:

$$
\lim_{x \to 0}{\frac{1}{x^7}} = \infty
$$

Why this happen? If $$x^7$$ approach to $$0$$, $$\frac{1}{x^7}$$ goes bigger and bigger, it's infinite.

As you can see, normally, if you are asked getting the limitation of a basic simple function, all you have to do is calculate the y value of f(x).
$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x \to 1}{x^2 + 5} &= 6
\\ \\
\lim_{x \to -2}{\sin(x + 2)} &= 0
\\ \\
\lim_{x \to 1}{\sqrt[999]{x^{277}}} &= 1
\end{align*}
$$
Do you understand?

Above is a graph of $$f(x) = x^2$$.
If I ask you what's the limitation of $$\lim_{x \to 2}{x^2}$$. The real meaning is $$\lim_{x \to 2}{{x^2}^-}$$ and $$\lim_{x \to 2}{{x^2}^+}$$ exist and equal.

$$\lim_{x \to 2}{{x^2}^-}$$ means `x` from `less than 2` to `2`, what y will approaching to.
$$\lim_{x \to 2}{{x^2}^+}$$ means `x` form `greater than 2` to `2`, what y will approaching to.

Here comes a new definition of continuity when you think about it.
No mater greater than 2 or less than 2, they all approaching 4, this means they are continuous in x and y.
