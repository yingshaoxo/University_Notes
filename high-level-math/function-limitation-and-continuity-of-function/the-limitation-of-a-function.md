But so sad that I can't draw graphs for this book on this period of time.

$$
\lim_{x \to \infty}{\frac{1}{x^2}} = 0
$$

Why this happen? We could imagine, if $$x^2$$ goes on and on, to infinite, $$\frac{1}{x^2}$$ will more and more approaching $$0$$.

There's another limit equation that similar to the above:

$$
\lim_{x \to 0}{\frac{1}{x^7}} = \infty
$$

Why this happen? If $$x^7$$ approach to $$0$$, $$\frac{1}{x^7}$$ goes bigger and bigger, it's infinite.

As you can see, normally, if you are asked getting the limitation of a basic simple function, all you have to do is calculate the y value of f(x).
$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{x \to 1}{x^2 + 5} &= 6
\\ \\
\lim_{x \to -2}{\sin(x + 2)} &= 0
\\ \\
\lim_{x \to 1}{\sqrt[999]{x^{277}}} &= 1
\end{align*}
$$

Above is a graph of $$f(x) = x^2$$.

If I ask you what's the limitation of $$\lim_{x \to 2}{x^2}$$, the real meaning is $$\lim_{x \to 2}{{x^2}^{-}}$$ and $$\lim_{x \to 2}{{x^2}^{+}}$$ **exist and equal.**
