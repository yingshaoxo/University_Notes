But so sad that I can't draw graphs for this book on this time.

$$
\lim_{x\to\infty}{\frac{1}{x^2}} = 0
$$

Why this happen? We could imagine, if $$x^2$$ goes on and on, to infinite, $$\frac{1}{x^2}$$ will more and more approaching $$0$$.

There's another limit equation that similar to the above:

$$
\lim_{x\to 0}{\frac{1}{x^7}} = \infty
$$

Why this happen? If $$x^7$$ approach to $$0$$, $$\frac{1}{x^7}$$ goes bigger and bigger, it's infinite.
