#### The meaning of $$\int$$


$$\int$$ is kind of like $$S$$ in $$sum$$.

$$\int_1^4 x$$ means $$1 + ... + 2 + ... + 3 + ... + 4$$

So, $$\int \frac{dy}{dx} dx = \int dy$$ means infinite $$dy$$, because $$dy$$ actually is original function $$f(x)$$, if we want to make it infinite, we should add or minus a number to it, we call that number `C`. Finally we got $$\int dy = dy + C$$

One thing you should know is that $$dy + C$$ means so many many $$f(x)$$ which composed with $$dy$$ adding or subtracting a unknown random number $$C$$
