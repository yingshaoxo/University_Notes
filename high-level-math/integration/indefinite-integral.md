#### The meaning of $$\int$$


> $$\int$$ is kind of like $$S$$ in $$sum$$.


$$\int_1^4 x$$ is different than $$\sum_{n=1}^{4} n$$. 

In $$\sum_{n=1}^{4} n$$, n can only be increased by 1. So it will be $$1 + 2 + 3 + 4$$. 


But in $$\int_1^4 x$$, $$x$$ can be any number in interval $$[1, 4]$$. So it will be $$1 + ... + 2 + ... + 3 + ... + 4$$


> So $$\int \frac{dy}{dx} dx = \int dy$$ means infinite $$dy$$.

Here $$dy$$ actually is the original function $$f(x)$$. 

If we want to make it infinite, we should add or minus a number to it, we call that number `C`. Finally we got $$\int dy = dy + C$$

One thing you should know is that $$dy + C$$ means so many many $$f(x)$$ which composed with $$dy$$ adding or subtracting a unknown random number $$C$$
