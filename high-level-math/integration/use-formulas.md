Basically, there are two types of indefinite integral formula.

One is `polynomial`, which composed by $$+$$ and $$-$$

Another is `composite function`, which composed by $$\times$$ and $$\div$$

For the first type of integral, we use basic formula to each part of it directly:
$$
\begin{align*}
&\int \frac{3x^2 - 2x + 1}{x} dx 
\\ \\ 
=& \int (3x - 2 + \frac{1}{x}) dx
\\ \\
=& \frac{3}{2}x^2 - 2x + \ln{|x|} + C
\end{align*}
$$

For the second one, oh my god, it's very complicated.

##### method 1, (see it as a part)

$$
\begin{align*}
&\int 1 dx &\text{//this make sense, }x^\prime = 1
\\ \\ 
=&

\\ \\ \\ \\
&\int (3x-1)^{2017} dx &\text{//a formula composed by} \times
\\ \\ 
=&
\end{align*}
