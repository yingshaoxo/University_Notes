#### What is derivative? 
If it really have some meaning, that must be describing the average change in `y` when `x` get change.

The $$|y^\prime|$$ bigger on one point, the $$y$$ of the function change more when $$x$$ increases. It seems the slop of the tangent line will steeper then.

The $$|y^\prime|$$ smaller on one point until 0, the $$y$$ of the function change less when $$x$$ decreases. It seems the slop of the tangent line gentler then.

If $$y^\prime$$ is positive, $$y$$ will goes up.

If $$y^\prime$$ is negative, $$y$$ will goes down. 

It is the same thing if you replace $$y^\prime$$ with $$f^\prime(x)$$.

#### Derivative notation
1. Lagrange's notation
$$
f^\prime(x)
$$
$$
y^\prime
$$

2. Leibniz's notation
$$
\frac{df(x)}{dx}
$$
$$
\frac{dy}{dx}
$$

  $$d$$ means a small change.

3. Newton's notation
$$
