##### What is derivative? (I don't know either)
The derivative of a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change in its argument (input value). Derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus.

##### Derivative notation
1. Lagrange's notation
$$
f^\prime(x)
\\ \\
y^\prime
$$

2. Leibniz's notation
$$
\frac{df(x)}{dx}
\\ \\
\frac{dy}{dx}
$$
$$d$$ means a small change

3. Newton's notation
$$
\dot y
$$
