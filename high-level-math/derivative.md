#### Let's do basic
`Derivative`(衍生物或派生物) is some extracted thing from another thing. It may be a feature or characteristic, it's a abstract model for describing one thing in a highly view.

`Delta`($$\Delta$$) is a duration expressing the difference between two data, time or date-time. We can seemly see this as a distance between two distance.

`Differential` is a descriptor for describing difference between two things. 

**Sometimes we can see `Delta` and `Differential` as the same thing.**

#### Derivative notation
0. Original notation
$$
\lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0}{\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}}
$$

1. Lagrange's notation
$$
f^\prime(x)
$$
$$
y^\prime
$$

2. Leibniz's notation
$$
\frac{df(x)}{dx}
$$
$$
\frac{dy}{dx}
$$

  $$d$$ means small change. 
  
  **You can read it: `differential in x` over `differential in y` is `the derivative of that function`.**

3. Newton's notation
$$
\dot y
$$
___

#### What is derivative? 
If it really have some meaning, that must be describing the average change in `y` when `x` get changed by this formula: $$\lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0}{\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}}$$

In that formula, when we assume that the change in x is very small, near to 0, then the change in y becomes a tending, indicated where y is about to going.

#### What function feature derivative described?

![](/assets/negative_x^2.png)

The $$|y^\prime|$$ bigger on one point, the $$y$$ of that function changes more when $$x$$ increases. It seems the slop of the tangent line will steeper then.

The $$|y^\prime|$$ smaller on one point until 0, the $$y$$ of that function changes less when $$x$$ decreases. It seems the slop of the tangent line gentler then.

If $$y^\prime$$ is positive, $$y$$ will going up.

If $$y^\prime$$ is negative, $$y$$ will going down. 

It is the same thing if you replace $$y^\prime$$ with $$f^\prime(x)$$.
