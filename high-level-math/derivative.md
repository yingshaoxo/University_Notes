#### What is derivative? (I don't know either)
~~The derivative of a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of the function value (output value) with respect to a change in its argument (input value). Derivatives are a fundamental tool of calculus.~~

You don't have to know anyway. It's too complicated to understand.

If it really have some meaning, that must be describing the changing rate of a function on one point(input x).

The $$|y^\prime|$$ bigger on one point, the $$y$$ of the function change more quickly. It seems the slop of the tangent line steeper.

The $$|y^\prime|$$ smaller on one point until 0, the $$y$$ of the function change more slowly. It seems the slop of the tangent line gentler.

If $$y^\prime$$ is positive, $$y$$ will goes up.

If $$y^\prime$$ is negative, $$y$$ will goes down. 

It is the same thing if you replace $$y^\prime$$ with $$f^\prime(x)$$.

#### Derivative notation
1. Lagrange's notation
$$
f^\prime(x)
$$
$$
y^\prime
$$

2. Leibniz's notation
$$
\frac{df(x)}{dx}
$$
$$
\frac{dy}{dx}
$$

  $$d$$ means a small change.

3. Newton's notation
$$
\dot y
$$
