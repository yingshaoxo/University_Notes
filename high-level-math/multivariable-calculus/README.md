# Multivariable calculus

`multiple variable calculus`, that is to say: a function which have multiple parameters, and you must do calculus with it.

Multi-variable calculus \(also known as multivariate calculus\) is the extension of calculus in one variable to calculus with functions of several variables: the differentiation and integration of functions involving multiple variables, rather than just one.

~~Why we have to learn it? Well, simply enough, when you trying to get an object's volume, all you have to do is find its~~ `2-D area formula`~~, then do integration with its height.~~
