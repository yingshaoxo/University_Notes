**RC circuit**: a circuit made by `resistor` and `capacitor`.

**RL circuit**: a circuit made by `resistor` and `inductor`. 

**LC circuit**: a circuit made by `inductor` and `capacitor`.

**RLC circuit**: a circuit made by `resistor`, `inductor` and `capacitor`.

Why use `L` instead of `I` to represente `Inductor`? 

Well, maybe simplly because we already represented `current` using `I`.
