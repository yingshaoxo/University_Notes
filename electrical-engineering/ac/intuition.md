### 3 basic components in AP circuit: 

#### Resistor
> Resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages.

#### Inductor
> An inductor, is a two-terminal electrical component that stores electrical energy in **a magnetic field** when electric current flows through it.

#### Capacitor.
> A capacitor is a two-terminal electrical component that stores electrical energy in **an electric field**.
