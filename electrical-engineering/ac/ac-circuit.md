### 3 basic components in AP circuit: 

#### Resistor
> Resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages.

#### Inductor
> An inductor, is a two-terminal electrical component that stores electrical energy in **a magnetic field** when electric current flows through it.

#### Capacitor.
> A capacitor is a two-terminal electrical component that stores electrical energy in **an electric field**.

___

### What's the purpose of 3 basic components in AP circuit?

> If we need to block DC we use a capacitor.

> If we need to block very high frequency AC we use an inductor.

> If we need to design a filter we (can) use resistors, capacitors and inductors.
