### 3 basic components in AP circuit: 

#### Resistor
> Resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages.

#### Inductor
> An inductor, is a two-terminal electrical component that stores electrical energy in **a magnetic field** when electric current flows through it.

#### Capacitor.
> A capacitor is a two-terminal electrical component that stores electrical energy in **an electric field**.

___

### What's the purpose of 3 basic components in AP circuit?

> If we need to block DC, we use a capacitor.

> If we need to block very high frequency AC, we use an inductor. 如果电感器在没有电流通过的状态下，电路接通时它将试图阻碍电流流过它；如果电感器在有电流通过的状态下，电路断开时它将试图维持电流不变。类似于稳(压)器。

> If we need to design a filter, we (can) use resistors, capacitors and inductors. 它具有充放电特性和阻止直流电流通过，允许交流电流通过的能力。

___

### As the previous

No matter in DC or AC, those components all have `current` and `voltage`.

So we have to find out how to represente those things using vector formula.
