Linearity 线性

Suppress 镇压；使什么止住

The principle of superposition is another name for the additivity property of Linearity: $$f(x_1 + x_2) = f(x_1) + f(x_2)$$

To solve a circuit using superposition:

> 1. Suppress all power sources
>
>    > To suppress a voltage source, replace it with a short circuit. \(replace it with conductive wire\) To suppress a current source, replace it with an open circuit. \(cut wire off\)
>
> 2. Analyze the resulting simpler circuits individually.
> 3. Calculate the sum of individual results.
